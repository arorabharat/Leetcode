I picked up one of my most valuable skills — clear technical communication and documentation — from a principal engineer who mentored me. Early in my career, my design docs tended to dive too quickly into implementation details. They were technically correct, but they didn’t help readers understand *why* the problem mattered or how the solution fit into the broader system.

Working closely with this principal engineer changed that. He showed me how to refine a problem statement until it captured the real customer or system pain point, not just the symptoms. He also taught me to intentionally separate problem framing from implementation, so reviewers could reason about the design at the right level of abstraction. Instead of jumping into APIs or data flows, I learned to start with the context: what constraints exist, what trade-offs we are navigating, and what future directions the product might take.

I began applying these principles in my own documents — setting context clearly, articulating scope and non-goals, and explaining decisions in a way that made sense even to someone new to the domain. The difference was immediate. Discussions became more productive, cross-team alignment became easier, and reviewers often commented that my documents felt “forward compatible” because they anticipated future evolution.

That skill has become foundational to how I work now. Whether I’m writing a design doc, proposing a workflow change, or driving a cross-team discussion, I start by sharpening the problem and making the narrative readable for everyone involved. It’s one of those skills that quietly lifts the quality of every technical decision afterward, and it’s something I continue to develop and pass on to newer engineers.
