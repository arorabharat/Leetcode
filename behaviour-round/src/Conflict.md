There was a time when Prime leadership was exploring new surface areas to expand Prime upsell opportunities. One high-visibility location identified for this was the homepage bottom sheet — a surface owned by the Amazon Pay team. They had designed that bottom sheet specifically for bill-payment reminders, and they were also under pressure to increase usage of their platform. So both orgs saw the same slot as a high-value opportunity.

The conflict emerged because the Amazon Pay team assumed Prime upsells could be integrated quickly, similar to their billing flows. But Prime is a subscription product with far more complexity — benefit messaging, discount communication, eligibility checks, renewals, and strict UX expectations. None of these aligned cleanly with the billing-focused platform. Leadership on both sides was pushing to move fast, while the technical reality was far more nuanced.

I led the technical evaluation from the Prime side and quickly realized the gap between perception and actual feasibility. But instead of pushing back emotionally, I drove a structured deep dive. Over the course of a week, I documented every Prime-specific requirement, the edge cases that would fail on the existing platform, and the long-term risks of forcing the integration without proper redesign.

We walked both PMs and engineering leads through the findings. Once we grounded the conversation in concrete scenarios rather than assumptions, the tone shifted. Both teams aligned on the fact that this wasn’t a plug-and-play integration; it needed real engineering work.

From there, we divided responsibilities. My team took ownership of building the Prime-specific logic and flows needed to support subscription upsells, while the Amazon Pay team committed to reviewing changes and ensuring platform compatibility. With clear expectations and shared understanding, we moved forward smoothly.

The feature eventually launched and is now live on the homepage — the same bottom sheet that shows targeted Prime offers when a customer is close to expiry or eligible for a promotion.

For me, the experience underscored a simple truth about conflicts in engineering: most of them aren’t disagreements in intent, but disagreements in context. Once both teams saw the full technical landscape, alignment came naturally and collaboration improved.
