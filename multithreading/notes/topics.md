### Round 1 & 2: System Coding 1 (Multithreading and Concurrency + problem solving)
### Key Areas to Focus:
Threads and Concurrency:
* Thread creation and lifecycle.
* Synchronization (locks, synchronized, ReentrantLock).
* Thread communication (wait/notify, semaphores).
* Thread pools (Executors framework).
* Deadlock, livelock, and starvation.
* Read/Write locks, CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier.
Example Problem:  Thread-Safe Data Structure: Implement a data structure to track incoming requests by IP address and potentially other attributes (e.g., BrowserAgent).
You will need to focus on ensuring thread safety while handling concurrent updates to the data structure.
