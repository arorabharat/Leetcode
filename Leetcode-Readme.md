## Important

1. Complete linked list
2. Complete trie

## Time complexity

Let's understand all the time complexity based on the addition operation in an arraylist.

### Worst case

In worst case array's capacity has reached to add one more element, we will have to increase the size of the underlying
array and copy all the elements to new array of double the size. Hence time taken would be O(N)

### best case

Best case would be O(1) when we array size less then capacity

### Average time complexity

Average time complexity would be ( best case + worst case ) / number of times operation performed. It will be slightly
larger than O(1.XX) as array size increases rarely.

### Amortized time complexity

Amortized complexity is the time complexity excluding the worst cases scenario which occur rarely like array size
increase. So, Amortized time complexity of add operation no array is O(1). It is more like round off of average time
complexity
