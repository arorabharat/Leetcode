| 1  | **“Tell me about a challenging / impactful project you worked on — what technical hurdles you faced, how you solved them.”** For example: “Describe a challenging software project you have worked on. What were the key technical hurdles, and how did you address them.” ([Glassdoor][1])              |
| 2  | **“Walk me through your day-to-day at your current (or previous) company.”** What were your responsibilities, what kinds of problems you solved. ([Glassdoor][2])                                                                                                                                        |
| 3  | **“Why do you want to join Postman — what attracts you, what do you expect to do here?”** Motivation / culture fit / alignment questions. ([LeetCode][3])                                                                                                                                                |
| 4  | **“Talk about a time you disagreed with a technical decision and argued for a different approach.”** Tests communication, judgment, conviction, collaboration. ([Glassdoor][1])                                                                                                                          |
| 5  | **“Design a system or service (high-level / large-scale) — e.g. a notification system, chat app, scheduling or job-runner, or similar.”** In some cases HM (or final rounds) included system design / architecture questions. ([Glassdoor][4])                                                           |
| 6  | **“How would you debug or profile a system when things go wrong — for example, slow API responses, database latency, caching problems?”** Emphasis on real-world, production-style thinking (not just “solve this toy problem”). ([Glassdoor][1])                                                        |
| 7  | **“Database / storage design & data-model questions — when to use SQL vs NoSQL, indexing, sharding, handling growth / scalability, trade-offs between monolith vs microservices, event-driven architecture vs traditional request-response, etc.”** Especially for backend-heavy roles. ([Glassdoor][1]) |
| 8  | **“Explain what happens (end-to-end) when you hit a URL in a browser / when an HTTP request is made — from networking / DNS / TCP / HTTP basics to server handling.”** Even for non-pure-front-end roles, they seem to probe fundamentals. ([Glassdoor][1])                                              |
| 9  | **“Given a skeleton codebase / repo (FE or BE), add functionality (CRUD / UI / API) — a short implementation or small project exercise.”** This has been reported for FE + full-stack interviews. ([Glassdoor][5])                                                                                       |
| 10 | **“Talk about a feature you shipped in past / previous org — design + planning + implementation + lessons learnt / trade-offs / optimizations.”** Focus on real world deliverables rather than toy problems. ([Glassdoor][6])                                                                            |
| 11 | **“System reliability or “guaranteed execution” type design questions — e.g. design a service that runs scheduled jobs with 100% guarantee or handles retries / failures.”** Tests thinking around reliability, idempotency, distributed systems. ([Glassdoor][7])                                       |
| 12 | **“Behavioral / soft-skills questions — teamwork, communication, conflict resolution, collaborating across teams, mentoring/leadership (for senior roles).”** These often come up in HM / final rounds. ([Glassdoor][1])                                                                                 |
| 13 | **“Walk me through the most interesting or complex feature you’ve implemented — what problem did it solve, what were key design choices, how would you scale it further or improve it now?”** High-level design + growth mindset introspection. ([Glassdoor][6])                                         |
| 14 | **“Tech fundamentals check — depending on role: networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP), databases, event-driven systems, system design fundamentals.”** Even in HM round for some full-stack roles. ([Interview Experiences][8])                                                                                    |
| 15 | **“Open-ended / exploratory questions — e.g. design a chat app (or similar) from scratch; or sketch a small system; or discuss design trade-offs.”** Encourages reasoning, not just memorized answers. ([Glassdoor][5])                                                                                  |
