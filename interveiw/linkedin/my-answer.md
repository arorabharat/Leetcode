### Give an example of a time when one of your ideas or proposals was not accepted by your team. How did you respond? – This probes your humility and teamwork: did you adapt or learn from the feedback?.

I propsed a design to unify the prime service and create single entry point for all the prime services which would server the data from the all the dependent services, the design was evaluated , it was to eligiminate the pain of integrating mulitple downstream services everytime we move to new location and to remove the scattered business logic which was hard to maintain. Principle engineer highlighted that there is similar initative going to cme at much broader scale with a framework spability which will not only aggregate the logic but also unify the CX for different UI location so even moving a UI component with e2e functionality would become easier not only the backened , hence my propsal was not taken forwarded, but dow the line 1 year when the suggested architecture was adopted I migrated most of the widget to new architecture ,


A good example was when I proposed an architecture to unify Prime backend services behind a single entry point.

At the time, each Prime UI surface had to integrate with multiple downstream services, and business logic was scattered and hard to maintain—especially when launching in new marketplaces. My proposal aimed to centralize this logic and reduce repeated integration work.

During the design review, a Principal Engineer pointed out that while the idea was directionally correct, there was already a broader initiative in flight—a framework that would not only aggregate backend logic but also standardize the end-to-end customer experience across UI surfaces. The key feedback was that my design solved the backend problem well, but the larger initiative would solve both backend and frontend mobility at a much bigger scale.

Initially, it was disappointing because the pain I was trying to solve was real. But instead of pushing back, I took a step back and aligned with the bigger picture. I asked to understand the new framework deeply and adjusted my focus from proposing an alternative to helping make the chosen direction successful.

About a year later, when that architecture was adopted, I led the migration of most Prime widgets onto the new framework. Because I already understood the original problem space and the new system’s goals, I could move quickly and help other teams onboard as well.

What I learned from this is that a good idea isn’t always the right idea at that moment. Sometimes the highest impact comes not from winning a design debate, but from supporting the best long-term direction and executing it well.

###  Describe a time when you realized you lacked an important skill on a project. How did you address it? – Focus on self-awareness and learning: did you acquire the skill, seek help, or adjust your approach?.

This happened a year back when I was majjoriyly solving the problem of retention and paymentment but the acquistion team was budiling a frmework called galileo which unifed all the the user experience , they built a framework which I would say a practcial implmentation of request coalescing , bulkhead design and downstream call parallelisation, as the acqusition side majorily read heavy load and the work involved on frontened components , as I onboarded to one of project which also required showing stacking upsell on the various home page location, quicly I realised there is need for this framework and also realised I lacked sufficent skill on thsi fraemwork to move quickly on my project, so I went through the document , collaborated with lot of folks to understand how it worked and read through the code base, but still made some mistake but eventually I learn the framework at level that I provided challenged certain convention used in few service which were not fully aligned to the framework core tenent

### Why do you want to work at LinkedIn, and why are you interested in this role? – The interviewer is looking for alignment with LinkedIn’s mission/values and how your background fits the role.

I’m interested in LinkedIn because its mission—creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce—is something I genuinely connect with as an engineer. LinkedIn operates at the intersection of identity, trust, and large-scale distributed systems, and the work has very real impact on how people grow their careers.

From a technical perspective, the role excites me because it sits squarely in the space I’ve been working in for the last several years: high-scale backend systems, platform thinking, and cross-functional execution. At Amazon, I’ve worked on subscription platforms, payments, retention, and acquisition flows where correctness, latency, and reliability directly impacted customer trust and revenue. That experience maps well to LinkedIn’s member-facing and platform services, where small backend decisions can influence millions of users.

I’m also drawn to LinkedIn’s culture. The emphasis on thoughtful decision-making, collaboration across product and design, and long-term platform investments resonates with how I like to work. I’ve seen firsthand that the best systems are built when engineers don’t just ship features, but help shape the architecture and simplify the ecosystem for others.

Finally, this role feels like a strong next step for me. It lets me apply what I’ve learned about scaling systems and navigating ambiguity, while growing in an environment that values both technical depth and product impact. That combination—mission, scale, and engineering culture—is what makes LinkedIn particularly compelling to me.
