📞 Phone Screen:

1️⃣ Problem 1: Rotate a linked list by n nodes.
2️⃣ Problem 2: Find the maximum sum subarray in a given array.

Performance: Solved both problems successfully within the given time, explained edge cases, and clearly outlined time and space complexities. The interviewer seemed satisfied with the code and explanation.

📩 After the phone screen, I received a call from the recruiter to schedule the onsite loop rounds.

💻 Onsite Round 1 (Coding):
1️⃣ Problem 1: Check if a graph is bipartite.
(Given a list of key–value pairs representing nodes, determine if we can divide them into two groups such that no key–value pair belongs to the same group.)

2️⃣ Problem 2: Given logs with function name, start time, and end time — find:

Total time taken by each function

Exclusive time excluding sub-function execution.

Performance: Solved both problems and provided working code.
For the first problem, the interviewer felt I used multiple arrays and suggested optimizing space usage. We ran out of time while discussing the optimization.

💻 Onsite Round 2 (Coding):

1️⃣ Problem 1: The Celebrity Problem.
(Given a matrix of people, find if there’s a person who is known by everyone but doesn’t know anyone.)

2️⃣ Problem 2: Given a list of 0’s and 1’s where some 0’s can be flipped to 1’s, find the maximum length of consecutive 1’s that can be formed.

Performance: Solved both problems with code within time, discussed test cases and edge cases, and explained the logic and complexity clearly.

🧠 Onsite Round 3 (System Design):
Problem: Design an Exception Metric Collection and Alarming System.

Handle millions of exceptions per second.

Support keyword-based search for exceptions.

Provide Top K most frequent and Top K least frequent exception queries.

Include an alerting mechanism when specific exceptions cross a threshold.

Performance: The round went well. I was able to come up with functional and non-functional requirements, define scale, entities, and APIs, and then provide a design that met the requirements.
There was also a question around the internals of Elasticsearch, which I couldn’t answer fully as I haven’t worked with it hands-on.

💬 Onsite Round 4 (Technical Communication):

Focused on one of my previous large-scale projects, discussing:

Design decisions and trade-offs

Technology choices and alternatives

Scalability and reliability considerations

Performance: Explained the project architecture and reasoning behind design choices in depth.
👥 Onsite Round 5 (Host Manager Round Apps):

Started with an overview of my past projects, followed by:

Discussion on why LinkedIn and why this role

A real-world design problem: build a system to collect feature button click counts and show aggregated metrics over time for Product Managers

Performance: Shared my motivation for joining LinkedIn and how my experience aligns with the role. Approached the design problem methodically, covering data collection, aggregation, and scalability.

Verdict: Selected

Overall, it was a great experience — each round tested a different dimension of engineering: algorithms, system design, and communication. Learned a lot through the process and enjoyed the conversations throughout. 🚀

** Update **

I had a team match round after this with linked in sales navigator team and it is successful would update this with compensation details once received
