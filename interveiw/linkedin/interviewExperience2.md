After 5 years of experience as a backend engineer (B.Tech CSE, Tier-1), I had the opportunity to interview for Senior Software Engineer – Systems Infra at LinkedIn.

Here’s how the entire process went — 7 rounds in total, spread across multiple days 👇


---

☎️ Round 1 – Phone Screening

Duration: 20 minutes

Discussion: Past projects, resume walkthrough, and core CS fundamentals (Java, OS, CN).

DSA Problem: Nested List Weight Sum
✅ Feedback: Strong Hire — completed the problem with an optimal approach and clear explanations.



---

💻 Round 2 – Coding 1

Problem 1: All O(1) Data Structure

Problem 2: Binary Tree Upside Down
✅ Feedback: Weak Hire — solved both problems, but my approach for the second differed from the expected one. Learned an important lesson: sometimes clarity of reasoning matters as much as correctness.



---

⚙️ Round 3 – Coding 2

Problem 1: Topological Sort (Standard DSA)

Problem 2: Max Consecutive Ones III
✅ Feedback: Strong Hire — completed both problems with ~15 minutes remaining. Confidence booster round.



---

🧠 Round 4 – High-Level Design (HLD)

Problem: Design “Top N Articles Shared” system

Discussed:

Count-Min Sketch, MapReduce, Spark Jobs, Heap, Maps, etc.


Focused on scalability, approximations, and data infra tradeoffs.
✅ Feedback: Strong Hire



---

🧍‍♂️ Round 5 – Hiring Manager Round

Deep dive into a past project — picked one with strong technical and business impact.

Discussed:

System architecture

Product reasoning

✅ Feedback: Strong Hire




---

🔁 Re-evaluation: Redo of Coding + HLD

A week later, HR reached out — the Hiring Manager requested a senior Systems Infra panel for one more coding + HLD onsite round.


---

💡 Round 6 – Coding (Redo)

Problem 1: Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) – Duplicates Allowed

Problem 2: Find the Celebrity
✅ Feedback: Strong Hire



---

🧱 Round 7 – High-Level Design (Infra Focus)

Problem: Build a Key-Value Storage System (get, put, delete)

Discussion went deep into infra internals:

B-Trees, LSM Trees

SSD writes & fragmentation

Write amplification, compaction

Layered Bloom Filters

DB crash recovery via WAL (Write-Ahead Log)
✅ Feedback: Strong Hire — one of the most technical and enjoyable rounds of my career.




---

🎉 Final Result

After a week, HR called — Offer Extended! 🎊


---

📚 Preparation Notes

Practiced DSA from LeetCode — focusing on clarity and time management.

System Design prep included exploring infra-level concepts (Bloom Filters, LSM Trees, Count-Min Sketch) beyond standard HLD resources.

Watched tech talks and deep dives from LinkedIn Engineering, YouTube, and InfoQ.
