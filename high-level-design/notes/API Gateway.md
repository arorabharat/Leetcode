# API Gateway ‚Äì Key Concepts and Features

[![Alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vHQqQBYJtLI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQqQBYJtLI)

## Use Case: E-commerce Application

* **URLs**:

    * `/home`: Returns static **HTML** and **JS** files.
    * `/products`: Returns product list in **JSON** format.
    * `/cart`: Requires user to be **logged in** to view/add items.
    * Admin-only URLs (e.g., add/delete product) require **authorization**.

* **Client Devices**: Requests can come from **desktop** or **mobile**.

* **Security Requirements**:

    * Use **HTTPS** with **SSL certificates**.
    * **Rotate SSL certificates** every 30‚Äì60 days (best practice).

## What is an API Gateway?

* **Definition**: An **entry point** for all API requests.
* **Purpose**: Separates **cross-cutting concerns** (security, auth, routing, logging) from business logic.

---

## Core Features of API Gateway

### 1. Cross-Cutting Concerns

* **Authentication**: Ensures users are logged in for protected APIs (e.g., cart).
* **Authorization**: Validates user roles (e.g., admin for product changes).
* **SSL/TLS Termination**: Handles **HTTPS** and certificate rotation.
* Protects APIs from **bad actors**.

---

### 2. Routing

* **Monolith to Microservices**:

    * `/home` ‚Üí Microservice 1.
    * `/products` ‚Üí Microservice 2.
* Centralized routing via API Gateway ensures:

    * Requests are sent to the correct **microservice**.
    * Simplified client interaction (clients only talk to gateway).

---

### 3. Response Handling

* **Request Aggregation**:

    * Instead of multiple client calls (recommendations, trending products, discounts), client makes **1 call**.
    * API Gateway **calls all services**, aggregates responses, and returns **single response**.
* **Static Content**: Gateway can directly serve static files (removes need for static-serving microservice).
* **Caching**:

    * Frequently requested responses (e.g., trending products recalculated hourly) can be cached in gateway.
    * Reduces load on backend microservices.

---

### 4. Advanced Routing

* **Device-based Routing**:

    * Mobile ‚Üí Low-quality video service (fast).
    * Desktop ‚Üí High-quality video service (slower).
* **Load Balancing**:

    * Round-robin distribution across service copies.
* **Canary Releases / A/B Testing**:

    * Route small % of traffic (e.g., 5%) to new version.
    * Route majority to stable version.

---

### 5. Protocol Handling

* Supports **protocol translation**:

    * Converts **HTTP/2** or **WebSocket** requests to older **HTTP/1.1** if backend services don‚Äôt support them.
* Enables adoption of new protocols without modifying services.

---

### 6. Monitoring and Logging

* Centralized **request/response logging**.
* Metrics:

    * **Latency**
    * **Request counts**
    * **Error rates**
* Built-in **dashboards** for performance monitoring.

---

### 7. API Monetization

* Example: **Payment Service**

    * A reliable payment microservice can be exposed via API Gateway.
    * Published in **API marketplace** (e.g., AWS API Gateway).
    * Clients are **charged per API call**.

---

## Common API Gateway Implementations

* **On-Prem / VM**:

    * **Apache**
    * **Nginx**
    * **Spring Cloud Gateway**
* **Cloud-Managed Services**:

    * **AWS API Gateway**
    * **Azure API Management**
    * **Google Cloud Endpoints**

## Key Takeaways

* **API Gateway = Entry point + Guard + Aggregator + Router**.
* Handles **auth, SSL, routing, caching, load balancing, monitoring** centrally.
* Simplifies client communication in **microservices architecture**.
* Provides flexibility for **protocols**, **traffic shaping**, and **monetization**.

## Quick Analogy

* **API Gateway** = *Reception desk* of a company ‚Üí verifies identity, decides where to send you, enforces rules.
* **Load Balancer** = *Traffic cop* ‚Üí evenly directs cars (requests) to multiple lanes (instances).
* **Service Mesh** = *Internal office manager* ‚Üí manages how employees (services) talk to each other, ensures security
  and efficiency.

---

üëâ For interviews:

* Stress **API Gateway = external entry point**.
* **Load Balancer = distributes load, ensures availability**.
* **Service Mesh = manages internal service-to-service communication**.

Do you also want me to create a **Mermaid diagram** showing where each (Gateway, Load Balancer, Service Mesh) sits in a
typical microservices architecture?
