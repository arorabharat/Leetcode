This video explains three-tier architecture, a popular software design pattern (0:03). It's easy to get started with and separates an application into three logical layers:

Client Tier (Presentation Layer): What the user sees and interacts with, like a web browser or mobile app (0:49).
Logic Tier (Business Logic): Handles the application's core rules and processes, often through APIs (1:43). It acts as an intermediary between the client and data tiers (3:54).
Data Tier (Persistence Layer): Stores and manages the application's data, typically databases (2:29).
The video also touches on alternatives like two-tier architecture (4:27) and service-oriented architecture (5:14).

Pros of three-tier architecture include ease of setup (6:31) and independent scaling of logic and data tiers (7:07).

Cons include the tendency to become monolithic, leading to difficult maintenance (8:04) and coupled deployments (9:12).
