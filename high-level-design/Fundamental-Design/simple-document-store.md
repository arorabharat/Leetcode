Alright, let’s close the loop and describe the **full end-to-end service stack** for a **Create / Read / Delete–only document system**, from the client all the way down to durable storage.

No fluff. No optional toys. Just what you actually need.

I’ll describe it in **layers**, because that’s how reliable systems stay understandable.

---

## 1️⃣ Client Layer (Producers & Consumers)

**Who lives here**

* Web apps
* Mobile apps
* Other backend services

**What it does**

* Sends `CreateDocument`, `ReadDocument`, `DeleteDocument`
* Retries safely (idempotent creates)
* Carries session token / region hint (optional)

**Design assumptions**

* Clients are unreliable
* Requests may be retried
* Network may duplicate calls

So the backend must be idempotent by default.

---

## 2️⃣ Edge & Traffic Management Layer

### Components

* Global load balancer / DNS
* Regional traffic routing
* Health-based failover

**Responsibilities**

* Route requests to the nearest healthy region
* Fail over automatically on region outage
* No business logic

This layer exists purely to keep the system reachable.

---

## 3️⃣ API Layer (Stateless Document Service)

This is the **core service** you’re actually designing.

### Service: `DocumentService`

**Endpoints**

```
POST   /documents
GET    /documents/{documentId}
DELETE /documents/{documentId}
```

**Responsibilities**

* Input validation
* Document ID generation (UUID v4 / Snowflake / UUID v7)
* Idempotency handling
* Read-your-writes logic (optional)
* Translating storage errors → API responses
* Observability (metrics, tracing)

**Key property**

> Stateless. Always stateless.

Every request can hit any instance.

---

## 4️⃣ Identity & Idempotency Support (Small but critical)

### Idempotency subsystem

* Idempotency key stored alongside document metadata
* Prevents duplicate document creation on retries

This avoids:

* Duplicate documents
* Broken client retries
* Phantom writes

---

## 5️⃣ Primary Data Store (Single Source of Truth)

### Distributed Key-Value Store

**What it stores**

```
Key: DocumentID
--------------------------------
content: string (≤ 2 KB)
status: ACTIVE | DELETED
created_at
delete_at (TTL)
checksum
```

**Properties**

* Multi-AZ replication
* Async multi-region replication
* Tunable consistency
* High write availability

**Why KV store works perfectly here**

* Access pattern is always `get by ID`
* No updates
* No joins
* No scans
* Tiny payloads

This is the backbone of the system.

---

## 6️⃣ Delete Safety & Lifecycle Management

Deletes are **logical first**, physical later.

### How it works

* Delete sets `status = DELETED`
* `delete_at` timestamp is written
* Storage engine auto-expires rows via TTL

**Why this matters**

* Prevents accidental data loss
* Handles concurrent reads safely
* No blocking cleanup operations

Logical deletes make distributed systems calm.

---

## 7️⃣ Background & Control Plane Services

![Image](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E22289_01/html/821-1273/figures/repl-mon.png)

These services never sit on the critical path.

### Background workers

* Monitor replication lag
* Verify TTL deletions
* Clean orphaned records (rare)
* Emit health metrics

### Observability stack

* Metrics: latency, error rate, stale reads
* Logs: document lifecycle
* Traces: create → read → delete

If you can’t see the system, you can’t trust it.

---

## 8️⃣ End-to-End Request Flow (All Operations)

### Create

```
Client
 → Load Balancer
 → DocumentService
 → Generate DocumentID
 → Write to KV Store (W=1)
 → ACK
```

### Read

```
Client
 → Load Balancer
 → DocumentService
 → Read from nearest replica (R=1)
 → Return content if ACTIVE
```

### Delete

```
Client
 → Load Balancer
 → DocumentService
 → Set status=DELETED + TTL
 → ACK
```

No locks. No transactions. No coordination.

---

## 9️⃣ Concurrency Model (Why this never breaks)

* **Create vs Read** → eventual consistency window is acceptable
* **Read vs Delete** → tombstone always wins
* **Create vs Create** → unique IDs + idempotency
* **Failures** → handled by replication and retries

Concurrency is solved by **immutability**, not synchronization.

---

## 10️⃣ Minimal Service Inventory (What you’d list in an interview)

If asked: *“What services are involved end-to-end?”*

You answer:

> Client, global load balancer, stateless document service, distributed key-value store with multi-region replication, background lifecycle workers, and observability services.

That’s it.

Anything more is optimization, not necessity.

---

## Final Mental Model (Important)

This system works because:

* IDs are generated locally
* Data is immutable
* Deletes are logical
* Reads never block
* Writes never coordinate

You’ve built a **small but real distributed system**, not a CRUD app pretending to be one.

---

If you want next, we can:

* Draw this as a **single whiteboard diagram**
* Add **auth & authorization**
* Discuss **strong consistency mode**
* Stress test at **10M reads/sec**
* Convert this into **code-level LLD**

This design is done. Everything else is refinement.


Perfect place to slow down and be precise. **Idempotency sounds abstract until you see the exact state transitions.** Let’s walk it end-to-end with **one concrete flow**, no hand-waving.

I’ll explain:

1. what problem idempotency solves
2. the exact data we store
3. the exact request flow (step by step)
4. all failure scenarios
5. why this works with our Create / Read / Delete–only system

---

## 1️⃣ What problem are we solving?

**Reality:**
Clients retry. Networks drop ACKs. Load balancers retry. Mobile apps panic.

So this happens:

```
Client → CreateDocument
(Server stores document)
(Server crashes before responding)

Client retries CreateDocument
```

Without idempotency → **duplicate documents**
With idempotency → **same document returned**

**Goal:**

> Multiple identical Create requests should behave like **one request executed once**.

---

## 2️⃣ Core idea (one sentence)

> The client supplies an **Idempotency Key**, and the server remembers the result of the *first successful request* made with that key.

That’s it. Everything else is mechanics.

---

## 3️⃣ What data do we store?

We add **one small table / logical record**.

### Idempotency Record

```
Key: idempotency_key
--------------------------------
document_id
request_hash
status: IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED
created_at
```

This lives in the **same KV store** as documents (or a separate table in the same system).

---

## 4️⃣ Client behavior (important)

For **CreateDocument only**:

* Client generates a **unique idempotency key**
* Same key is reused **for retries**
* Different create = different key

Example HTTP header:

```
Idempotency-Key: 9f7c2a91-6a21-4d9a-b1b8-77b9e3d9aabc
```

Deletes and reads usually don’t need idempotency, but they can reuse the same pattern.

---

## 5️⃣ Create flow (step by step, no gaps)

Let’s walk through the **happy path first**.

### Step 1: Client sends request

```
POST /documents
Headers:
  Idempotency-Key: K1

Body:
  "Hello world, 150 words..."
```

---

### Step 2: API server checks idempotency table

```
GET idempotency_record WHERE key = K1
```

#### Case A: **No record exists**

→ This is the first attempt
→ Server **creates an idempotency record**

```
K1 → {
  status: IN_PROGRESS
}
```

This write is **atomic**.

---

### Step 3: Server creates document

* Generate `DocumentID`
* Store document in KV store
* Status = ACTIVE

---

### Step 4: Server finalizes idempotency record

```
K1 → {
  status: COMPLETED
  document_id: D123
}
```

---

### Step 5: Server responds

```
201 Created
document_id = D123
```

---

## 6️⃣ Retry flow (this is the magic)

Now imagine the server **crashes after Step 4 but before Step 5**.

Client retries with the **same Idempotency-Key (K1)**.

---

### Step 1 (retry): API checks idempotency table

```
GET idempotency_record WHERE key = K1
```

#### Case B: **Record exists + COMPLETED**

Server immediately returns:

```
200 OK
document_id = D123
```

❗ No new document is created
❗ No duplicate write
❗ No race condition

---

## 7️⃣ What if retry happens mid-flight?

This is the subtle case interviewers care about.

### Scenario

* First request created idempotency record
* Status = IN_PROGRESS
* Document creation not finished yet
* Client retries immediately

### Server behavior

```
GET idempotency_record WHERE key = K1
```

#### Case C: **IN_PROGRESS**

Two safe options:

### Option 1 (simple & common)

* Return `409 Conflict` or `202 Accepted`
* Client retries after backoff

### Option 2 (cleaner UX)

* Block briefly (few ms)
* Re-check record
* Return result if completed

Either way:

* No duplicate document
* No inconsistent state

---

## 8️⃣ Why this works perfectly for *our* system

This design is especially strong because:

### 1. No updates

Once a document is created, it never changes.
So returning the same `document_id` is always correct.

### 2. DocumentID is generated **server-side**

So client retries cannot accidentally generate new IDs.

### 3. Small payload

Storing idempotency records is cheap.

### 4. Availability-first

Even under retries, partitions, crashes:

* At most one document is created
* System never blocks globally

---

## 9️⃣ Delete idempotency (quick note)

Delete is already **naturally idempotent**:

```
DELETE /documents/D123
```

* First call → status = DELETED
* Second call → still DELETED → return success

So idempotency keys are optional for delete.

---

## 🔁 Full lifecycle summary (single view)

```
Client
  |
  | Create (Idempotency-Key = K1)
  v
Document Service
  |
  | Check idempotency table
  | Create record (IN_PROGRESS)
  |
  | Create document
  |
  | Mark idempotency COMPLETED
  v
Return document_id
```

Retries short-circuit at the idempotency check.

---

## 🔑 Interview-grade explanation (concise)

> We ensure idempotency by requiring clients to send an idempotency key with create requests. The server stores the result of the first successful request associated with that key. On retries, the server detects the existing record and returns the previously created document ID instead of creating a new document. This guarantees at-most-once creation even under retries, crashes, or network failures.

---

## Final intuition (important)

Idempotency is **not** about retries.
It’s about **remembering outcomes**.

Once you internalize that, the whole flow becomes obvious.

If you want next, we can:

* Draw this as a **state machine**
* Discuss **TTL for idempotency keys**
* Compare **client-generated IDs vs idempotency keys**
* Implement this in **Java / Spring / Go**

This is a foundational distributed-systems pattern—and now you truly have it.
