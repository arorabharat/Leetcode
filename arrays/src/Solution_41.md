Here are a few nudges toward the classic $O(N)$, $O(1)$-extra-space solution:

1. **Constrain the search space**

    * The first missing positive has to lie in the range $[1,\,N+1]$ if your array length is $N$.
    * Any number $\le0$ or $>N$ can safely be treated as “out of range” (e.g. set it to $N+1$).

2. **Use the array itself as your “hash table”**

    * Your goal is to put each value $v$ (where $1 \le v \le N$) into index $v-1$.
    * Loop through the array, and **swap** each out-of-place positive into its correct slot:

      ```
      while (nums[i] in [1..N]  
             && nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i]) {  
          swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]);  
      }  
      ```
    * This single pass will move as many numbers as possible to their “home” indices.

3. **Scan for the first gap**

    * After the swaps, the first index `i` where `nums[i] != i+1` tells you the missing positive is `i+1`.
    * If every slot `0…N-1` holds the right value, the answer is `N+1`.

Putting that all together gives you a linear-time, constant-space algorithm—no extra arrays or maps needed. Let me know
